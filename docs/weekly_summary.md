# Weekly Progress Summary

Rolling weekly summary for instructor discussions. Newest week on top. Each
entry: per-topic key points + output (graph/table) locations. Math is plain
text (no LaTeX), per repo convention.

All experiments: CIFAR-100, DINOv2 embeddings, exchangeable pipeline
(PCA-128 + cluster-whiten fit off cal), alpha = 0.1, unless noted.

## Week ending 2026-06-22 (work on 06-21 to 06-22)

### 1. Centroid (cal-only) vs Cluster (unlabeled pool) MS-CS — does the cluster M update correctly per test point?

**Question.** In transductive Full CP every test point x is added to the bag
once per candidate label yc. The MS-CS similarity matrix M must update for that
augmented point. We wanted to confirm the **cluster M** (from the unlabeled
pool's k-means) updates correctly when the test point enters — i.e. does not
silently break exchangeability or produce degenerate sets.

**Mechanism verified.** Adding one point labelled yc shifts only class yc's
centroid, so the LOO update touches **only row/col yc of M** (O(K); O(1) for
cluster-M if yc's assigned cluster is unchanged), and the yhat update touches
only column yc. Exact vs brute-force LOO semantics.

**Empirical confirmation** (balanced cal+test, 10 trials, lambda=0.05,
tau = 0.5 * median_d^2). Six arms = 2 feature sources (separate 10k **pool** vs
**transductive** cal+test fit) x {cluster M, centroid M, no-penalty FCP}. Set
size (coverage in parens):

| arm | cal=200 | cal=400 | cal=800 |
|-----|---------|---------|---------|
| cluster-pool         | 7.21 (.943) | **2.05** (.907) | **1.58** (.921) |
| centroid-pool        | 8.50 (.941) | 2.15 (.909) | 1.59 (.920) |
| FCP-pool (lam=0)     | 8.93 (.943) | 2.28 (.911) | 1.63 (.920) |
| cluster-transductive | 12.52 (.942)| 2.58 (.908) | 1.72 (.920) |
| centroid-transductive| 14.42 (.943)| 2.77 (.905) | 1.72 (.920) |
| FCP-transductive     | 14.85 (.944)| 2.99 (.907) | 1.77 (.920) |

**Key points:**
- **Cluster update is correct.** All six arms stay valid (coverage 0.90-0.94,
  over-covering as expected for the balanced split — never under). A broken
  per-test update would show up as under-coverage or set blow-up; neither
  appears. The cluster-pool penalty cleanly beats its FCP-pool baseline
  (1.58 vs 1.63, ~3% @ cal=800; 2.05 vs 2.28, ~10% @ cal=400).
- **Cluster ~= centroid from cal>=400.** The unlabeled pool's value *for the M
  source* is a small-cal insurance only: cluster beats centroid ~15% @ cal=200
  (7.21 vs 8.50) but only ~1% @ cal=800. PCA denoises the cal class-centroids,
  so the cal-only centroid M recovers almost all the gain at cal>=400 — and
  needs **no pool** (pool-free, still exchangeable via the per-test centroid
  update; small change in `src/exchangeable_fcp_experiment.py`).
- **Separate pool > transductive (cal+test) features** on this balanced
  protocol (1.58 vs 1.72 @ cal=800) — the 10k pool earns its keep through the
  feature transform, not the M source.

**Output:** `output/balanced_mscs_source/balanced_mscs_source.png` + `results.json`.

### 2. K-shot test — effect of balancing cal+test, and the new default split

**What we did.** Definitive 3-arm A/B over the k-shot (C x k) protocol, 30
trials, post-missing-class-fix pipeline:
- `random` — label-blind split (exactly-exchangeable reference)
- `balanced_cal` — balanced cal, random test
- `balanced_both` — balanced cal AND test, equal shots m_cal == m_test (new)

| shots (cal=test) | random cov / sz | balanced_both cov / sz |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 2 (200) | .9055 / 20.96 | .9198 / **5.36** |
| 4 (400) | .9033 / 3.36  | .9053 / **2.15** |
| 6 (600) | .9011 / **1.96** | .9299 / 2.18 |
| 8 (800) | .9012 / 1.68  | .9159 / 1.62 |

**Key points:**
- **Random is exactly tight** at every cal (0.901-0.906) even at cal=200 with
  13-15 classes missing from cal — the exact guarantee holds.
- **Balanced over-covers, peak +3.1pp @ cal=600** (conservative, never under).
  Balancing the *test* set too does NOT remove it => the over-coverage is the
  **bag-dependence / anchor-count channel**, not marginal label-shift (clean
  mechanism result). The cal=600 spike reproduces the old "92.5% @ cal=600"
  anomaly; conjecture: peaks where m-1 = NCM's k (5 same-class LOO anchors).
- **Set size flips with regime:** balanced wins big at small cal (-40 to -73%
  @ cal<=400), ties/loses ~+18% @ cal=600, ties @ 800. CovGap: balanced always
  better (tail-class protection).
- **DECISION (2026-06-21): default = balanced cal + balanced test, equal
  shots/class, fresh each trial.** Rationale: comparability with few-shot CP
  lit (jusiro FCA / SCA-T, the C x k protocol), every class present in both,
  smaller sets, better CovGap. Cost is mild and safe-direction (over-covers
  ~1-3pp). **Always also report the random arm** for the exact-validity claim.
  Implemented as `balanced_both` split + pilot-fixed-T in
  `src/exchangeable_fcp_experiment.py`.

**Output:** `output/split_ablation/` — `split_ablation.png` (3-panel:
coverage-vs-band / log set size / CovGap), `split_ablation_3arm.png`,
`split_ablation_results.json`, `balanced_both_results.json`.

### 3. FCA paper adaptation (in progress — extend as cluster results land)

**What FCA is / our adaptation.** FCA (Silva-Rodriguez / jusiro,
arXiv:2506.06076 — conformal for medical VLMs) uses a closed-form "SS-Text"
linear probe `w_c = scaled_class_mean + text_anchor`. We have no text encoder,
so we **drop the text anchor and anchor on the class mean**, restoring
discriminativeness via a ridge covariance term:
`w_c = (Z^T Z + (lam+lam_a) I)^{-1} (Z^T y_c + lam_a * mu_c)` -> softmax ->
NCM = 1 - p(y|x) (LAC/THR). New class `RidgeSoftmaxNCM`,
`create_ncm("ridge_softmax", ...)`.

**Key points:**
- **Exactly exchangeable (confirmed).** Per-candidate Full-CP refit = one
  Sherman-Morrison rank-1 update; exact LOO via ridge PRESS leverage. Oracle
  (fast vs brute-force LOO) matches to 1.9e-15; 20-trial random cal=400
  coverage 0.897. Caveat: temperature **T must be fixed** (pilot value); an
  auto-fit T is cal-dependent O(1/n) and under-covers.
- **Tightest at cal=800 on both splits** (fixed T=0.10, 5 trials): balanced
  1.45 vs 1.65 (geodesic asym) / 1.67 (mean) = -12/-13%; random 1.42 vs
  1.61/1.66 = -12/-14%. Competitive-to-best at cal=400.
- **Trade-off (not a clean dominate):** tighter sets but slightly worse CovGap
  than geodesic (cal=800: 7.5pp vs 6.3pp); under-covers @ cal=200 (m=2, LOO
  breakdown); CPU-only, ~6-7x slower than the GPU geodesic.
- **Status / "update later":** NCM + unit tests committed & pushed (branch
  `worktree-ridge-softmax-ncm`, commit `cef76b4`). Cluster benchmark script
  ready (`src/ridge_softmax_cluster_experiment.py`: cal 200-1800,
  CIFAR-100 + miniImageNet, metrics cov/sz/CovGap/runtime). NOT yet done: full
  cluster run (to launch), GPU/vectorized ridge path, MS-CS hooks, paper
  write-up.

**Output:** `output/ridge_softmax_compare/ridge_vs_geodesic.png` (3-NCM x
2-split) + `results_ridge_{bal,rand}.json` (currently in worktree
`.claude/worktrees/ridge-softmax-ncm/`); tests in
`tests/test_ridge_softmax_ncm.py`.

### Cross-cutting note

Topics 1-3 now all run on the **same balanced cal+test default** (topic 2's
decision), which is exactly the few-shot protocol FCA uses (topic 3) — so the
centroid/cluster and ridge results are directly lit-comparable. Standing rule:
pair every balanced headline with the random arm for the exact-validity
statement.
